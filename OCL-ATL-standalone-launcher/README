Test project for debugging a STANDALONE ATL transformation using OCL Pivot as source model.
Problem : directly launching the transformation (via launch config) works, but using the java launcher gives unknown types for OCL variables.
projects :

* OCL-ATL-standalone-transformation
This is the ATL transformation plugin. Generated by ATL wizard. Just added the run method for running the transformation with a given input model.
The transformation is OCL2Debug. It uses a dummy ecore as output, as the objective is only to display ATL debug messages in the console.
The transformation can be tested directly using the given launch configuration.

* OCL-ATL-standalone-launcher
A simple java project for initializing OCL standalone and running the transformation with the test model.
The test input model is C4AB.ocl.oclas, which is the abstract syntax of OCL constraints (C4AB.ocl) applied to the metamodel AB.ecore
the test can be done by running the Launcher.java as a java application.


Danae - I have changed the references to old example.pivot to new promoted pivot http://www.eclipse.org/ocl/2015/Pivot. 
Added load of AS Resource to trasformation project as suggested in Eclipse Forum but: 
* Issue with com.google.common.base.Predicate not found so I have added to build path com.google.Guava to references. This solves original issue but we got
* java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.log4j.Logger so include org.apache.log4j to build path
* com.google.inject.Module exception include ibrary to build path
Finally, I can see the same results when running by code that the ones displayed when running ATL config.
